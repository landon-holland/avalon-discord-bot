[Roles]
= Loyal Servants of Arthur =
Merlin: Can see all members of the evil side (except for Mordred).
Percival: Can see who Morgana and Percival are. Percival doesn't know who is who.
= Evil Minions of Mordred =
Mordred: Is invisible to Merlin.
Morgana: Pretends to be Merlin in order to throw Percival off.
Assassin: The assigned person to choose who they think Merlin is if the good side wins.
[Post-Game]
If the good side wins, there is a chance for the evil side to take the win.
If the evil side either votes who Merlin is, or the Assassin chooses who Merlin is, then the evil side wins.
