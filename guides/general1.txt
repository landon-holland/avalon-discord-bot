[Setup]
There are two sides: the Loyal Servants of Arthur (good) and the Evil Minions of Mordred (evil).
Each side has some special players which are covered in the [Roles] section.
All members of the evil side know who each other are.
Members of the good side do not know who is on either side.
[Gameplay]
The game consists of up to five rounds. Each round has a team building phase and a quest phase.
If three rounds succeed, then the good side wins. If three rounds fail, then the evil side wins.
= Team Building Phase =
One person will be assigned as a team leader. The person chosen to be team leader is assigned in a set order.
After discussion from everyone, the team leader will choose a team to go on the quest. (The size of the team depends on the round.)
The team leader or team members are not always on the good side, so appropriate discussion is necessary for who is on the team.
Once the team leader has chosen all of the team members, a vote is initiated.
(The team leader can put themself on the team.)
All players will vote on whether or not they accept or reject the team that the team leader has built.
If half or more than half of the players vote to reject, then a new team leader is chosen and the process starts over.
If a majority of players vote to accept, then the quest phase of gameplay begins with the assigned team.
(If a vote is rejected five times in one round, the evil side wins.)
= Quest Phase =
Now that a team has been selected. Each team member will individually and privately select whether to succeed or fail the quest.
The quest succeeds if all team members select to succeed the quest.
The quest will fail if one or more team members select to fail quest.
(If the game is played with more than seven players, then on the fourth round you need to team members to select to fail the quest in order to fail the quest.)
